abstract ={One option for addressing the bias that may result from survey nonresponse is to make greater use of the administrative records that federal and state agencies compile. Such records have been used to assess response bias but less often to correct for such error. Direct substitution of administrative records for survey data, as is done for income data in Canada, provides a means of compensating for survey nonresponse; but the limitations of such data must be recognized. Administrative records may not cover the entire population of interest, may utilize a different unit of observation, may have wide variation in data quality across items or by agency, and may have timeliness issues. In using administrative records, researchers cede control over the content of individual variables, which may differ from survey concepts and be subject to change. Furthermore, privacy protections embodied in law restrict the use of many types of administrative records.},

 ISSN = {00030554, 15375943},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1960778},
 abstract = {We examine the characteristics of a largely ignored low-turnout group--people who have recently moved. We find that neither demographic nor attitudinal attributes explain their lower turnout. Instead, the requirement that citizens must register anew after each change in residence constitutes the key stumbling block in the trip to the polls. Since nearly one-third of the nation moves every two years, moving has a large impact on national turnout rates. We offer a proposal to reduce the effect of residential mobility on turnout and estimate that turnout would increase by nine percentage points if the impact of moving could be removed. The partisan consequences of such a change would be marginal.},
